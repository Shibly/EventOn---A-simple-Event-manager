EventManager
============

Event Manager is a Symfony2 powerd event management system. Where an administrator can create an event and publish the event
based on the category created. An user can subscribe the events after registering with the site. 

This is my first SF2 project and there is possibly a lot of issues will be exists in this project. This is an initial upload.
I'll try to update it as well. 

By the way SF2 is a GREAT PHP framework available now a days.
